# Finding polygons containing a point

> Spike with MongoDB geo-spatial queries and Leaflet.js

## Using the spike

### Get everything running

```sh
yarn install
yarn start # to get the front-end running
yarn dev # to get the server running
```

### Draw some polygons

```sh
open http://localhost:3000
```

Draw some polygons on the map. They will be inserted in Mongo in GeoJSON format.

### Query the data

`POST` to `http://localhost:3001/search` with the latitude and longitude of a point you want to search with. Example:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"lat":"-1.5","long":"52.085"}' http://localhost:3001/search
```

Or if you have `httpie` installed:

```sh
http post http://localhost:3001/search lat=-1.5 long=52.085
```

## What I learnt

- You'll need to include both the `leaflet` and `leaflet-draw` npm packages.
- There are some useful `React` wrappers for Leaflet. This spike uses `react-leaflet` and `react-leaflet-draw`
- There are two CSS files that need to be included for the map to display properly: one for leaflet and one for leaflet draw - See `App.js`
- Data must be stored in GeoJSON, but can be nested within a larger document. Leaflet provides a function to get data in this format - see `Map.js`. Example data structure:

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "5a1e8e9e02c9357a111a4e35"
  },
  "location": {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {},
    "geometry": {
      "type": "Polygon",
      "coordinates": [
        [
          [-2.966309, 52.908902],
          [-1.07666, 52.928775],
          [-1.175537, 52.079506],
          [-2.537842, 52.086257],
          [-2.966309, 52.908902]
        ]
      ]
    }
  },
  "name": "Mary Estrada"
}
```

- You need to create a `2dsphere` index in Mongo. See `server.js`.
- The co-ordinates of the point you're querying with must also be provided in GeoJSON format. This means latitude comes first. See `server.js`.
